# Website_Home_Page
i designed this website from scratch using only HTML and CSS (flexbox)

so this is the clone of "usabilityhub.com" website
made this from scratch using html css and javascript
used so many concepts of css like flexbox, gridlayout and media queries and made this website fully responsive.
